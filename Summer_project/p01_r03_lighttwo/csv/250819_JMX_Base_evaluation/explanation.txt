Here we have the following situation. 
The base Cs2CO3 cannot dissolve and might be the main culprit behind slow reaction
The solution is to find a new bsae.
The variables are
1) Cs2CO3, CsF, DBU, DABCO, DIPEA, NEt3 ...
2) Solvent system
3) Concentration/equivalence

Here, in this csv, we will look only at varying 1) and 3)

What would be even better is that the only input you provide in the starting input csv is 
the smiles, rackID, name, IUPAC name, otation, equivalence, and volume per reaction.

Then, a python file would output all the other relevant information for you.

Another great idea would be giving in an input in the form of rows and columns for starting materials
and you get an output in the form of a table with the expected product, and their masses
